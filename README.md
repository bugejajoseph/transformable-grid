Transformable Grid

## Purpose

The idea of this simple prototype is to demonstrate how data can be displayed flexibly using AngularJS and HTML5/CSS3. In this example photos downloaded from Instagram are presented to the user either in a compact list-view with textual description or as big photos in grid format. All the data is fetched dynamically by interacting with an Instagram API endpoint using AngularJS RESTful 'controller'.

## Build

Replace client_id of src/js/script.js with your own.
