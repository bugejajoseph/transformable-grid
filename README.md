The idea of this simple prototype is to demonstrate how data can be displayed flexibly using AngularJS and HTML5/CSS3 technologies. In this example, photos downloaded from Instagram are presented to the user in a compact list view or in grid format with the use of a simple click. All the data is fetched dynamically by interfacing with an Instagram API endpoint over HTTPs protocol.
